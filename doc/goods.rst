.. admonition:: GOODS no longer maintained

    The stand-alone GOODS website is being replaced with options integrated into WebGNOME (e.g., the Operational Forecast Wizard). The GOODS application is still available during this transition but no longer actively maintained.
	
The GNOME Online Oceanographic Data Server (GOODS) provides access to a 
variety of data in a format that can be easily loaded into WebGNOME. Ocean 
current and wind data and forecasts from numerous sources are available. 

GOODS also includes a map generator tool that can be used to make a map
for WebGNOME.

Visit https://gnome.orr.noaa.gov/goods to access WebGNOME compatible data 
and forecasts through GOODS.
